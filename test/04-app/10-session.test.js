/*
 * Section 4, the OnlyKey APP: build it, start it, and prove the instrument.
 *
 * This is the file that raises section 4's long-lived process, and it is a
 * VISIBLE test rather than a hook for the same reason 03-gui/10-session is: a
 * wedge has to stay attributable to a step somebody can point at, and a start
 * that did not happen has to be as legible as one that did. 19-stop takes it
 * down again.
 *
 * NOT THE SAME APP AS SECTION 3. That one is onlykey.github.io in a browser
 * over the WebAuthn tunnel; this is OnlyKey-App, a packaged nw.js application
 * reaching the device with chrome.hid. See lib/app.js.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE ASKS FOR A DEVICE AT ALL, when it asserts nothing about one:
 * the App enumerates as it loads. Raising the gadget first means every later
 * file inherits an App that has already seen a device, rather than one that has
 * to be convinced to look again - and it is also how the file proves the two
 * can coexist at all, which was an open question when it was written.
 *
 * SURFACE: chrome.hid / CDP. Section 4 is a client test by construction: what
 * it asserts about is what the shipped App does, so there is no production-walk
 * question here the way there is for a console read.
