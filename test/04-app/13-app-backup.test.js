/*
 * Section 4: the App's Backup/Restore tab, against a backup the device made.
 *
 * THE APP'S OWN SUITE CANNOT REACH THIS AT ALL, and not merely because nobody
 * wrote the test. Its `chrome.hid` is mocked with canned strings, and a backup
 * is six hundred KEYSTROKES the device types on its keyboard interface over the
 * better part of a minute. There is nothing to mock: a backup is either produced
 * by a real device or it is a fixture somebody pasted in once, and a fixture
 * only ever proves the verifier still reads a file from the year it was made.
 *
 * So this file gets a REAL backup - the device types it, the kit captures it
 * off the keyboard interface, exactly as `01-protocol/10-backup-restore` does -
 * and then asks the App two questions about it.
 *
 * TWO VERIFIERS, ONE ARTEFACT, AND NEITHER WROTE IT. The backup's integrity is
 * a CHAIN of SHA256 values, one folded into the next per line, computed by the
 * firmware while it typed. `lib/device/backup.js` recomputes that chain, and the
 * App's `verifyBackupFile()` computes it again in its own code. The device is
 * the only author; the two verifiers are independent readers. That is the same
 * shape as `02-cli/00-venv` asserting the CLI and the kit agree about what the
 * device just said, and it is the strongest thing available here - a round trip
 * through one implementation would prove nothing, because a broken writer and
 * its matching reader agree perfectly.
 *
 * SURFACE: keyboard (the backup itself) and vendor (what the restore put back).
 * The debug console is read for ONE thing - the "Backing up Label Number" line
 * that says a hold was not discarded mid-fade - and that is a timing signal
 * rather than an assertion, the same use `10-backup-restore` makes of it.
 *
 * OUTSIDE `--isolate` AND `--reverse` BY CONSTRUCTION, like the rest of the
 * section. Within the file the backup is captured once and both tests read it,
 * which is the coupling this tier allows: capturing it twice would cost another
 * minute of typing to assert one more property of the same artefact.

   * from backup please wait..." with an empty error box - and then **nothing
   * reaches the device**: zero vendor replies and no reboot across 45 seconds,
   * with the device still answering `unlocked` throughout.
   *
   * Two readings, and this could not distinguish them, which is the whole
   * reason it is not asserted:
   *
   *   1. the App's restore stalls before it transmits, which would be a real
   *      defect in a path that carries a whole device's secrets, or
   *   2. `submitRestore()` reads the file with a FileReader, and a File
   *      injected by the debugger is not one this nw.js will read - a
   *      HARNESS artefact that says nothing about the App.
   *
   * What would settle it in one run: instrument `submitRestoreData()` from the
   * page - it is a top-level function, so it can be wrapped the way
   * `initSlotConfigForm` was in 04-app/11 - and see whether it is ever called
   * and with how many bytes. If it is called, the App is transmitting and the
   * fault is downstream; if it is not, the file never got read and reading 2
   * above is the likely one. See TODO.
   *
   * Worth noting what IS established meanwhile: the same backup restores fine
   * over the vendor interface, which `01-protocol/10-backup-restore` does end
   * to end, so the device half is not in question.
