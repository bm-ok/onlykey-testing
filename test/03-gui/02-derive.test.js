/*
 * Section 3, headless: derived keys, through the library the web app uses.
 *
 * `derive_public_key` and `derive_shared_secret` are what the password-generator
 * and vault pages are built on, and they are the pair the old kit only ever
 * reached through a browser (14-gui-password-generator). Reached from Node they
 * need no display and no USB, so what was a GUI test becomes something CI can
 * run - and when the GUI test is eventually written, a failure there with a pass
 * here says the PAGE is wrong rather than the device.
 *
 * The derivation is a device secret plus data the host supplies: the device
 * holds the derivation key and never emits it, and the same input always
 * produces the same key, which is the entire premise of "a different password
 * per site with nothing stored anywhere". Both properties are asserted below,
 * because neither is visible from a single successful call.
 *
 * press_required is false throughout. That is the "derived keys per site
 * without touch" path, and it is a device setting rather than a client choice
 * (derived_key_challenge_mode); if a device demands the press, these calls
 * simply never come back, so the file bounds itself rather than sitting there.
