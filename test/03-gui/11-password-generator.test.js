/*
 * Section 3, browser tier: the password-generator page, in a real Chromium,
 * against a real device.
 *
 * This is the first test in the kit where the DEVICE CALL GOES THROUGH THE
 * BROWSER. Everything below it in section 3 reaches the device by handing the
 * library a shim; here Chromium's own WebAuthn stack does it, over the USB
 * gadget, exactly as it would for somebody at onlykey.github.io. That is the
 * one thing the headless tier cannot prove, and the only reason to pay for a
 * display.
 *
 * What makes it worth having is the pairing. 02-derive already proved
 * derive_public_key and derive_shared_secret work when called directly, so if
 * this fails the page is at fault - the wiring, the ids, the click handler -
 * rather than the device or the library. That is the whole argument for two
 * tiers, and it only pays off if both exist.
 *
 * The assertion is a cross-check rather than a shape check: the same phrase is
 * derived twice, once by the page through Chromium and once by this kit through
 * its own CTAP2 over the in-process bus, and the two have to produce the same
 * secret. Two clients, two transports, one device. A page that merely put SOME
 * string in the output box would pass a "not empty" test and fail this one.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS AND IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. The device is unlocked BEFORE the page
 * opens. An app page loaded against a locked device times out its startup
 * OKCONNECT, and Chromium then raises a native WebAuthn dialog that no CDP
 * command can dismiss - which wedges the whole session, not just this file.

/*
 * localhost, NOT 127.0.0.1, and the difference is not cosmetic.
 *
 * The library asks for a WebAuthn assertion with `rpId = window.location.hostname`.
 * WebAuthn does not accept an IP address as a relying-party id, so a page served
 * from 127.0.0.1 fails with "SecurityError: This is an invalid domain." before
 * the device is ever contacted - and the page swallows it, so the only symptom
 * is an output box that never fills. `localhost` is special-cased by the spec
 * and works. The old kit used it too; this is why.
 *
 * The consequence is the interesting part. The RPID is folded into the
 * derivation - okcrypto_hkdf() reads it where okcrypto.cpp stages it - so a page
 * on localhost derives a DIFFERENT key from one on onlyagent.app, with no error
 * anywhere. The oracle below therefore has to ask for the same rpId the browser
 * will, or the cross-check compares two perfectly correct answers to different
 * questions.
