/*
 * The command line's own composite PQC operations: `setpqc`, `signpqc`,
 * `decryptpqc`.
 *
 * 05-composite-load and 06-composite-ops already prove the DEVICE does these
 * things - the first through a hand-written python snippet, the second through
 * the web app's library. Neither goes through `onlykey-cli`, and that turned
 * out to matter: until this file's fixes there was no CLI route to a composite
 * decrypt or signature at all, and the library functions that were supposed to
 * provide one could not return their own output.
 *
 * WHY THE SNIPPET IN 05 EXISTS is the whole story here. It says, in its own
 * comment, that it cannot call `pqc.sign()` because `read_string()` "DROPS
 * EVERY ZERO BYTE". That was true and it was only half the problem: underneath
 * it, `read_bytes()` is a single `self._hid.read(n)` of ONE 64-byte report with
 * no reassembly, so `read_string(...)[:3309]` for an ML-DSA-65 signature was
 * impossible by construction rather than unreliable. 64 bytes is the most it
 * could ever have returned. The ML-DSA test below is therefore the one that
 * could not have passed in any form before, and it is the reason to read this
 * file: it is the first time a 3309-byte response has been reassembled by
 * python-onlykey itself rather than by a test harness working around it.
 *
 * The first test is a different kind of pin. `setpqc` used to print "Loaded
 * composite PQC PGP key (160 bytes) into RSA1" and exit 0 for a load the device
 * had refused three times over, and nothing could catch that from outside:
 * okcrypto_getpubkey() has no KEYTYPE_PQC_PGP branch, so there is no readback,
 * and the only other evidence needs a button press. A test that asserts the
 * REFUSAL is the only instrument that works, and it has to run before the key
 * is loaded or the device would be in config mode already.
 *
 * SURFACE: vendor for every device operation; console only for the challenge
 * digits on the ML-KEM half, which no client surface reports. See PRODUCTION.md.
