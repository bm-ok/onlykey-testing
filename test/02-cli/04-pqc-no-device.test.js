/*
 * TC-07: decrypting with no device attached must FAIL, cleanly.
 *
 * The negative half of TC-05, and the one the old kit could not really run. It
 * needed a hand on the cable - it printed "please UNPLUG the OnlyKey now" and
 * waited up to two minutes for a human - so it was skipped unless somebody set
 * ONLYKEY_TEST_PHYSICAL_UNPLUG=yes, which in practice meant it did not run.
 *
 * The gadget can unplug itself. Unbinding it from its UDC is a real bus-level
 * disconnect: the host tears down the hidraw nodes, and hidapi - which is how
 * python-onlykey finds anything - sees no device at all. The firmware keeps
 * running with its RAM intact throughout, which a hand on the cable could not
 * have arranged either, since an OnlyKey is bus-powered and unplugging it cuts
 * power too. So this is not merely the old test automated; it is a cleaner
 * experiment than the old test could perform.
 *
 * What is under test is the FAILURE, and there are three ways to get it wrong
 * that all look like "it didn't work": hanging until something kills it,
 * exiting zero having produced nothing, and writing a truncated or empty output
 * file. A test that only checked the exit code would pass on the third.
