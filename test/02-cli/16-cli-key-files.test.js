/*
 * `loadpqc` and `loadkey` on their ACCEPTING paths - the last row of section 2.
 *
 * `12-cli-slots` drives both commands only as far as a file they cannot read,
 * which proves argument handling happens host-side and nothing else. What was
 * never covered is the half that does the work: **parsing a real OpenPGP private
 * key file** and putting what comes out of it on the device. These two commands
 * are the only place in the kit where a PGP FILE - the thing a person actually
 * has - is the input, and the parse happens in a Node/OpenPGP.js bridge that
 * python-onlykey shells out to, so it is a third implementation nothing has
 * checked against anything.
 *
 * THE FILES ARE GENERATED HERE, by the WEB APP's own vendored openpgp fork. That
 * is the same argument `05-composite-load` makes and it holds twice over: the
 * browser makes a key, a command line puts it on the device, neither can do the
 * other's job, and a disagreement about the format shows up here or nowhere.
 * Using a checked-in fixture key would test that the bridge still reads a file
 * from 2026 rather than that the two clients agree today.
 *
 * WHAT EACH COMMAND CAN BE ASKED FOR, because the two are not symmetrical:
 *
 *   loadpqc   composite PQC. There is NO READBACK - okcrypto_getpubkey() has no
 *             KEYTYPE_PQC_PGP branch, as okpqc.h says - so the only evidence a
 *             load worked is the device USING the key. This asks it to sign and
 *             verifies against the public half of the very file that was loaded.
 *   loadkey   classic RSA. The modulus IS readable, so this reads slots 1 and 2
 *             back over the vendor interface and checks them against what
 *             openpgp.js says the file's two halves are.
 *
 * THE SECOND ONE IS WORTH MORE THAN IT LOOKS, because of where the CLI puts the
 * halves. `loadkey`'s auto mode assigns "subkey 1 = decryption (slot 1), primary
 * = signing (slot 2)" - which is exactly the pair `onlykey-pgp.js`'s `slotid()`
 * hardcodes for the encrypt and decrypt pages. So this asserts that the CLI's
 * loader and the web app's key selection agree about a convention neither one
 * states, and that `03-gui/08` and `03-gui/14` would find the key where they
 * look for it if a person had loaded it this way rather than the way those files
 * do it themselves.
 *
 * SURFACES. The vendor interface carries every load and both moduli, so those
 * assertions survive into a production walk. The console is read only for the
 * challenge timing on the composite signature, through `lib/pqc.js`, which is
 * the same console-only dependency every challenge-answering test has.
