/*
 * The `onlykey-cli` endpoint sweep, part three: slots and key material.
 *
 * The first sweep file that WRITES KEY MATERIAL. Nothing here needs a wipe to
 * undo and no slot needs to be reserved for it: every file boots from a fresh
 * fixture image, so a key written here is gone before the next file starts.
 * The old kit handed slots out per file to stop one overwriting another's key
 * material - it lost whole runs to that - and that discipline is dead weight
 * here. Do not reintroduce it.
 *
 * Eight endpoints. `setslot` and `wipeslot` write the twelve profile slots -
 * the ones a button press types - and `setkey`, `genkey`, `wipekey`, `setpqc`,
 * `loadpqc` and `loadkey` write the key slots underneath them.
 *
 * SURFACES. Marked per test, as in 11-cli-settings, because a production key
 * ships without SEREMU and an assertion that reads the debug console cannot run
 * in a production walk - see PRODUCTION.md. This file needs the console for
 * nothing at all: every write is acknowledged by name on the vendor interface,
 * and the strongest assertion here reads a stored key back over the same
 * interface and checks it in pure JS.
 *
 * TWO GATES, WITH DIFFERENT WORDS FOR THE SAME CONDITION. Key material is
 * writable only in config mode, and the firmware says so twice, inconsistently:
 *
 *   OKSETPRIV  (setkey, genkey, setpqc)  "Error not in config mode"
 *   OKWIPEPRIV (wipekey)                 "Error device locked"
 *
 * The second is misleading - the device is unlocked, it is simply not in config
 * mode - and it is asserted here in the firmware's own wording rather than
 * corrected, because a test that asserted the sensible message would fail
 * against the firmware that ships. okcore.cpp's OKWIPEPRIV case falls through to
 * a shared `else` that predates the config-mode branch beside it.
 *
 * AND CONFIG MODE IS NOT A SUPERSET OF NORMAL OPERATION. `OKGETPUBKEY` is
 * REFUSED while in config mode - "ERROR NOT SUPPORTED IN CONFIG MODE", printed
 * to the debug console with no vendor reply at all, so a client sees only
 * silence. That is why the readback tests below reboot before reading: writing a
 * key and reading it back cannot happen in one mode.
