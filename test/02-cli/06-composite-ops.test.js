/*
 * TC-11, phase two: the WEB APP's composite calls, against a key the CLI put on
 * the device.
 *
 * 05-composite-load proved the key arrives intact, using python to sign. This
 * asks the same device the same question through `onlykey-3rd-party.js` -
 * `composite_sign` and `composite_decrypt`, the two calls the pgp-pqc page is
 * built on - so the browser's client is checked against the same key the
 * command line loaded.
 *
 * It sits in section 2 rather than section 3's headless tier for one reason:
 * loading the key needs `onlykey-cli setpqc`, and therefore a kernel device
 * node. That is section 2's admission test, and it does not stop being true
 * because the client under test happens to be the browser's. The headless tier
 * stays CI-able precisely by keeping files like this out of it.
 *
 * Both operations raise the three-button challenge - okpqc_sign() and
 * okpqc_decrypt() each prime and then do nothing until CRYPTO_AUTH reaches 4 -
 * and the library primes and polls from inside a promise rather than from a
 * child process, which is what lib/pqc.js's confirmWhilst() is for.
 *
 * The decryption half is covered three times over, deliberately, because the
 * three are different questions and only the first used to be asked:
 *
 *   - the X25519 half alone, 32 bytes in, one keyhandle out;
 *   - the ML-KEM-768 half alone, 1088 bytes, which is the MULTI-CHUNK send;
 *   - and one openpgp.decrypt() driving both, which is the page's own call
 *     path and the only one that raises TWO challenges in one operation.
 *
 * The last is what a browser used to be the only way to reach, and reaching it
 * here first is the same argument the rest of the kit makes: a failure with a
 * console in front of it is a finding, and the same failure inside nw.js is a
 * mystery.
