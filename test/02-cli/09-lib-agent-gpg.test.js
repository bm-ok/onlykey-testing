/*
 * TC-13, the GPG half: `onlykey-gpg init`, and the identity it leaves behind.
 *
 * DO NOT READ THIS AS THE SSH FILE WITH A DIFFERENT BINARY. lib-agent's
 * pubkey() branches on the identity's proto, and GPG takes the other side of
 * every branch that matters:
 *
 *                        08-lib-agent-ssh        this file
 *   hashed               user@host               the WHOLE identity string,
 *                                                `gpg://` + the user id
 *   pubkey slot          132                     132, but reached via
 *                                                get_sk_dk() rather than
 *                                                unconditionally
 *   keys derived         one (ed25519)           TWO - ed25519 to sign and
 *                                                curve25519 to decrypt
 *   signs anything       no                      yes, twice
 *   button challenge     none                    one per signature
 *
 * That last row is the real difference. Exporting a public key is a read;
 * `init` builds an OpenPGP key by SIGNING - a self-certification over the
 * primary, then a binding signature over the encryption subkey - and each
 * signature is gated on the three-button confirmation. So this is the first
 * lib-agent test that needs lib/pqc.js at all, and it needs it twice in one
 * command.
 *
 * The signature also takes a different firmware path from the pubkey export:
 * okcrypto_sign() dispatches slot 201, not 132, into okcrypto_ecdsa_eddsa(),
 * which is where `buffer[5] == 201` maps back to okcrypto_derive_key(1, ...).
 * lib-agent picks 201/202/203 by curve. Slot 132 is the OLD number for this and
 * is still what the pubkey call uses, which is worth knowing before reading
 * either as a typo.
 *
 * WHAT IS CHECKED, beyond `init` exiting 0:
 *
 *   - The digits lib-agent PRINTED for the user match the ones derived from the
 *     packet the device says it received. Those are computed on opposite sides
 *     of a multi-report send - lib-agent from sha256(blob+data) before sending,
 *     the device from what it reassembled - so agreeing means the whole
 *     send_large_message2() framing arrived intact. A dropped chunk shows up
 *     here as two different triples rather than as a confirmation that is
 *     mysteriously refused.
 *   - The key GnuPG ends up holding is the key THIS KIT derives for the same
 *     identity, asked for over the in-process vendor interface. Same three-way
 *     arrangement as the SSH file: without it, `init` succeeding only says
 *     lib-agent and gpg agreed with each other about whatever came back.
 *   - The homedir is wired to the device rather than to a software key -
 *     run-agent.sh naming the slots, gpg.conf pointing gpg at it.
 *
 * `--homedir` IS PASSED EXPLICITLY, ALWAYS. Without it run_init() defaults to
 * `~/.gnupg/onlykey`, which on a developer's machine is their own keyring. It
 * also refuses to reuse a directory that exists, so a retry needs a fresh path
 * rather than a cleaned one - the last test pins that refusal, because it is
 * the thing most likely to be mistaken for a device failure on a second run.

     * rather than a formality: `init` DOES leave a daemon behind, and that is
     * worth stating because it is not obvious from anything it prints.
     * run_init()'s last step is `gpg --list-secret-keys`, which makes gpg
     * launch the agent named in gpg.conf - so by the time the command exits
     * successfully there is a long-lived onlykey-gpg-agent holding the device's
     * hidraw node, and it outlives the test, the file and the run.
     *
     * NOT `gpgconf --kill all`, which is the documented way and does not work
     * here: it HANGS. gpgconf drives the agent over assuan and asks it things
     * the stock gpg-agent answers - the observed stall was
     * `gpg-connect-agent ... GETINFO tpm2d_running` - and onlykey-gpg-agent is
     * a different program that does not, so the call sits until its timeout.
     * Reading /proc and signalling the pid is both faster and honest about what
     * is being killed.
     *
     * This was found the expensive way: FOUR of these were running on this
     * machine from an earlier attempt at this row, forty hours old, with their
     * homedirs long since deleted. A test that starts a daemon and does not
     * stop it does not fail - it accumulates.
