/*
 * TC-16/17: the derived X-Wing path from the command line - no slot, no button.
 *
 * `03-pqc-decrypt` proves the STORED model: a key generated into slot 101, kept
 * there, and used. This is the other model the plugin supports. Nothing is
 * stored at all - the key is reproduced on demand from (the device's web
 * derivation key, a label, the RPID `onlyagent.app`) - and it is the same key
 * the web app's age-derive page produces, which is what makes CLI and browser
 * interoperable rather than merely similar.
 *
 * `03-gui/03-xwing-derive` already proves this maths against the device over
 * the CTAP2 vendor bridge. This is the same firmware arithmetic reached the
 * other way: raw HID, `OKGETPUBKEY`/`OKDECRYPT` with
 * `RESERVED_KEY_WEB_DERIVATION`. Two transports into one derivation, which is
 * the arrangement that catches a transport-shaped bug - and there was one here.
 * `okcrypto_decrypt()`'s dispatch used to require `(buffer[6] & 0x0F) ==
 * KEYTYPE_XWING`, but this request is 64 bytes over a 57-byte report, so
 * buffer[6] carries a continuation marker instead of a keytype and the check
 * matched neither chunk. Both fell through to slot dispatch, ran the wrong
 * decapsulation on a stale type, and returned a shared secret that never
 * matched - with no error anywhere. That is what this file is standing guard
 * over, and it is invisible to anything that only checks exit codes.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE ASSERTED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, and both are the point:
 *
 *   - NO BUTTON PRESS. This branch has no CRYPTO_AUTH gate, so none of
 *     lib/pqc.js's challenge machinery is involved. Rather than demonstrate
 *     that by not calling it, the tests count the device's own priming marker
 *     and require it not to move. A firmware change that started demanding a
 *     confirmation here would otherwise show up as this file timing out, which
 *     names nothing.
 *   - NO DEVICE for the identity. `cmd_identity_derived()` is pure local
 *     encoding - it is the label in an envelope, not a key - so it must work
 *     with the device doing nothing at all.
 *
 * No `derivedkeymode` setup either, and that is a real difference from
 * `03-gui/02-derive` rather than an omission: bit 3 is checked in
 * `fido2/ok_extension.cpp`, on the tunnelled path only. The raw-HID branch in
 * `okcrypto.cpp` has no such gate.
