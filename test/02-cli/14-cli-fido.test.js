/*
 * The `onlykey-cli` endpoint sweep, part five: the CLI's other half.
 *
 * Six endpoints that are not python-onlykey at all. cli.py hands `credential`,
 * `set-pin`, `change-pin`, `reset`, `wink`, `ping` and `rng` straight to
 * `solo.cli.key()` - the Solo FIDO2 CLI - which finds the device through
 * python-fido2 and speaks CTAPHID. So they reach the device over the FIDO
 * interface rather than the vendor one, and they fail in a different language
 * when they fail. `ping` and `rng` are already covered in 10-cli-reads because
 * they are reads; the four that change something are here.
 *
 * `set-pin` AND `change-pin` ARE THE FIDO2 CLIENT PIN, not the device PIN. A
 * reader who assumes otherwise would expect them to change what unlocks the
 * OnlyKey, and they do not - the device PIN is set by `init` over the vendor
 * interface, in 13-cli-lifecycle.
 *
 * THREE OF THE SIX ARE CURRENTLY BROKEN BY A HOST DEPENDENCY, and that is the
 * headline. `credential`, `set-pin` and `change-pin` all die inside solo with
 *
 *     AttributeError: 'Fido2Client' object has no attribute 'client_pin'
 *
 * which is solo calling an API the installed python-fido2 no longer exposes.
 * Nothing about the firmware is involved: the device answers, the client cannot
 * use the answer. Two of them then EXIT 0 while printing that error, so a
 * caller checking the exit code is told a PIN was set when none was.
 *
 * That makes the assertions here deliberately narrow. What is stable is that
 * each command REACHES THE DEVICE over FIDO, and that is what is asserted;
 * where the outcome is deterministic the wording is pinned too. When the venv's
 * fido2 and solo are brought back into step these will start failing, which is
 * the correct behaviour for a test whose subject is a known breakage.
 *
 * SURFACES, marked per test - see PRODUCTION.md. The FIDO interface survives
 * into a production walk, so counting reports on it is a production-safe way to
 * say "this command reached the device" without reading a debug line.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE FLASHES FIRMWARE AND NOTHING HERE RESETS THE AUTHENTICATOR. Both
 * commands are driven only as far as their confirmation prompts, which is the
 * part worth testing anyway: an interlock that can be bypassed is the bug, and
 * an interlock that holds is proven by the device staying silent behind it.
 *
 * `loadfirmware` IS `OKFWUPDATE`, AND ON A PHYSICAL KEY IT NEEDS THE SPECIAL
 * BOOTLOADER. RUNNING IT LOCKS THE BOOTLOADER AND PERMANENTLY CONVERTS A
 * DEVELOPER KEY INTO A PRODUCTION KEY. That is not "needs a reflash" - the key
 * is gone as a dev key, and nothing brings it back.
 *
 * So this file carries `emulated` in its metadata. That is a MECHANICAL gate,
 * not a note: the hardware adapter cannot run the file at all, and says why it
 * skipped. `client-access` already implies the gadget in practice, but "in
 * practice" is the wrong strength of guarantee for this one.
 *
 * WHAT EMULATION CANNOT COVER, stated so that the gap is by design rather than
 * by omission: FSEC lives in an anonymous mapping rebuilt on every boot, so the
 * emulator has no lock bits and the bootloader-lock path is not reachable there
 * at all. What IS testable is the framing, the interlocks and the refusals, and
 * that is what this file tests. THE DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR IS UNTESTED, and it
 * should stay that way.
