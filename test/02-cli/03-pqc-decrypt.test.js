/*
 * TC-05: encrypt on the host, decrypt on the device, get the file back.
 *
 * The end-to-end claim the other PQC tests only approach: real `age`, a real
 * age file, the real plugin, and a device that holds half the secret. Encryption
 * is host-only - X-Wing encapsulation needs nothing but the public key - so only
 * the decrypt half touches the device, and only it needs a button.
 *
 * This is also what the two keygen bugs actually cost. A device that stored a
 * different key from the one it reported, and a --generate whose recipient was a
 * status message with a key stapled to it, both produce exactly one symptom
 * here: "no identity matched any of the recipients". So this file is the proof
 * that libraries@83353cf fixed something real, in the only terms that matter -
 * a file encrypted to this key can be read back.
 *
 * Ordering is deliberate and the tests share state: generate, publish, encrypt,
 * decrypt, and only then clean up. A failure leaves the temp directory behind,
 * which is a feature - the age file that would not decrypt is the evidence.
