/*
 * The `onlykey-cli` endpoint sweep, part two: the settings family.
 *
 * Thirteen subcommands, all the same shape underneath - `setslot(1, FIELD,
 * int(value))` - and all of them writes to device settings rather than to key
 * material. `backuppassphrase` is NOT here despite belonging to the family by
 * name: it reads from stdin with prompt_toolkit and goes out as OKSETPRIV,
 * which is a different driving problem and a different message, so it sits with
 * the interactive commands in 13-cli-lifecycle.
 *
 * SURFACES, AND WHY THIS FILE STATES THEM PER TEST
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * A production key ships without SEREMU - it is a debugging interface and on a
 * security key it is a key-extraction path - so every assertion that reads the
 * debug console is an assertion that cannot run in a future production walk.
 * What survives is what a real client can see: the keyboard, the vendor
 * interface (0xFFAB) and FIDO (0xF1D0). See PRODUCTION.md.
 *
 * So each test says which surface it is asserting on, in these words:
 *
 *   SURFACE: vendor   - survives into a production walk
 *   SURFACE: console  - does NOT survive; stated with why it is the only oracle
 *
 * This file is almost entirely the first kind, and that is a property of the
 * firmware rather than of the tests: every one of these thirteen writes is
 * acknowledged BY NAME on the vendor interface. "Successfully set keyboard
 * layout" is a different string from "Successfully set typespeed", so the
 * acknowledgement identifies the field, and a CLI that sent the wrong one is
 * caught without reading a debug line. The refusals are equally specific -
 * "Error not in config mode" is the security property itself, arriving on the
 * surface an attacker would see.
 *
 * AND THE CLIENT HAS TO RELAY IT. Every test also asserts that the CLI's stdout
 * equals the device's reply, because those are two readers of one message: the
 * kit reads the vendor interface directly over the in-process bus, python-onlykey
 * reads it over USB through hidapi. Agreement means the answer reached the
 * client; the kit alone seeing it would not.
 *
 * `onlykey-cli` EXITS 0 WHEN THE DEVICE REFUSES. Every refusal below comes back
 * as exit 0 with an error string on stdout, which is the sharpest possible
 * demonstration of this section's rule that an endpoint is not covered by
 * exiting 0. A test that checked the exit code would pass on all thirteen while
 * the device rejected every one of them.
 *
 * Every test stands alone - `okt run <file> --test keylayout` - and is named
 * after its endpoint so that selects exactly one.
