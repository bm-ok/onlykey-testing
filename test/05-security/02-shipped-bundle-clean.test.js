/*
 * The bundle that actually ships carries no test hooks and no key logging.
 *
 * WHY THE BUNDLE AND NOT THE SOURCE. `docs/` is generated, tracked, and served -
 * BUILD.sh's last act is to write the CNAME into it - so it, not `src/`, is what
 * a visitor executes. A fix that lands in src/ and never reaches docs/ is not
 * deployed, and nothing else in this kit would notice: every other test loads
 * the library straight from src/. This file is the only thing standing between
 * "we fixed it" and "the served page still does it".
 *
 * It caught exactly that. After the transit key stopped being logged in src/,
 * the committed bundle still contained four "Transit shared secret" strings,
 * four "AES Key", and the window test hook, because docs/ had last been built
 * before the strip.
 *
 * WHY `NODE_ENV === "production"` IS NOT THE ANSWER for the test hook, which is
 * the trap worth recording: `BUILD.sh` with no argument runs `build-site`, which
 * is `NODE_ENV=development`, and that is what has been committed to docs/ (the
 * bundle carries the string "development"). `BUILD.sh 1` is the production
 * build and is what heroku-postbuild runs. So gating a debug global on a
 * production check leaves it present in the artifact this repo actually serves.
 * Removing it is the only fix that reaches the deployed page.
 *
 * `device: false` - the subject is a build artifact.
