 * The vendor interface (RawHID2, usage page 0xFFAB) - the one the app, the CLI

 * anything that reads its status has to know which one it is looking at:
 *
 *   locked        answers nothing, but broadcasts "INITIALIZED" once a second
 *                 whether anyone asked or not
 *   unlocked      answers OKCONNECT, and printed the model string on unlock
 *   uninitialized broadcasts nothing at all - there is no HID task for it
