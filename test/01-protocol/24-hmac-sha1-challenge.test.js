/*
 * Section 1: Yubikey-style HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response over HID CONTROL
 * TRANSFERS on the keyboard interface.
 *
 * NOT `15-hmac-secret`. That file is FIDO2's `hmac-secret` extension - CTAP2,
 * on the FIDO interface, salts wrapped for a password manager. This is the
 * Yubikey challenge-response protocol reached through SET_REPORT (0x0921) and
 * GET_REPORT (0x01a1), which is a different mechanism on a different interface
 * with different guards. They share three letters and nothing else, and they
 * sit in the same directory, so the distinction is stated here rather than left
 * to whoever greps for "hmac" next.
 *
 * GATED `emulated`, OUT LOUD. The hardware adapter THROWS for kbdSetReport and
 * kbdGetReport by design - hidraw would need HIDIOCSFEATURE/HIDIOCGFEATURE and
 * the udev access to read a workstation's keyboard interface, which is a
 * separate piece of work. Without this gate the file fails on a key for a
 * reason that looks like a device fault rather than an unbuilt seam.
 *
 * THIS IS A THIRD COMMAND CHANNEL. `process_setreport()` (okcore.cpp:7657)
 * sits beside the vendor interface and the WebAuthn tunnel, and it is the least
 * examined of the three - not by judgement but because the harness could not
 * reach it until the IPC verbs landed. It also outlives the debug console: a
 * production key ships without SEREMU, and the keyboard interface ships on
 * every build because it is the device's primary function.
 *
 * SURFACE: the keyboard interface's control transfers, for everything. The
 * debug console is not read anywhere in this file, so it survives into a
 * production walk.
 *
 * THE WIRE PROTOCOL, since none of it is guessable and all of it cost a read:
 *
 *   - A 70-byte `keyboard_buffer` is filled SEVEN BYTES AT A TIME. Each
 *     SET_REPORT carries 8 bytes: 7 of payload plus a sequence marker
 *     0x80..0x89 in byte 7, and the firmware copies to
 *     `keyboard_buffer[i + (marker - 0x80) * 7]`.
 *   - **The copy happens inside GET_REPORT, not SET_REPORT.** So every frame
 *     must be followed by a GET_REPORT or nothing lands. That is the Yubikey
 *     personalization protocol's write-then-poll shape, and a sender that only
 *     writes gets a device that never received anything.
 *   - `check_crc()` is CRC-16/MCRF4XX over bytes 0..63 only, little-endian at
 *     [65..66]. **The slot selector at [64] is NOT covered by it**, which is
 *     worth knowing before trusting the checksum to protect the routing.
 *   - The answer comes back as FOUR GET_REPORTs of 8 bytes, walking
 *     `getBuffer[8]` 0x40 -> 0x43, each ending in its own marker: 0xC0 at
 *     kb[7], 0xC1 at [15], 0xC2 at [23], 0xC3 at [31].
 *   - The 20-byte HMAC is SPLIT across those reports - kb[0..6], kb[8..14],
 *     kb[16..21] - with the CRC-16/X-25 of the HMAC at kb[22] (low) and kb[24]
 *     (high), and a constant 0x4B at kb[28] the source calls a "mystery byte".
 *
 * TWO SLOT-SELECTOR VOCABULARIES, WHICH IS THE TRAP THIS FILE WAS NEARLY BUILT
 * WRONG ON. `keyboard_buffer[64]` means different things in different branches:
 * 1 and 3 WRITE a key (to slots 130 and 129), while 0x30 and 0x38 CHALLENGE
 * those same two slots. TODO carried 0x30/0x38, was "corrected" to 1/3, and
 * that correction was wrong - both are real, for different operations.
