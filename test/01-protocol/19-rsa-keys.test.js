/*
 * Classic RSA: OKSETPRIV, OKGETPUBKEY, OKSIGN, OKDECRYPT and OKWIPEPRIV against
 * a stored RSA-2048 key.
 *
 * RSA was the one key type of the six with no coverage at all.
 * `01-protocol/14-stored-keys` drives the other five - ed25519, nist256p1,
 * secp256k1, curve25519 and the two PQC types - and every one of those lives in
 * an ECC slot and goes through `okcrypto_ecdsa_eddsa()` or its decrypt twin.
 * `okcrypto_rsasign()` and `okcrypto_rsadecrypt()` had never had a byte sent at
 * them by any test in either kit. `13-large-response` writes RSA slot 1, but with
 * `KEYTYPE_PQC_PGP`, which `okcrypto_sign()` routes to `okpqc_sign()` before the
 * RSA branch is reached - so that file proves nothing about RSA either.
 *
 * SECTION 1 ON PURPOSE, same argument as 14-stored-keys: section 2 can never run
 * against a physical key and section 3's headless tier drives the emulator by
 * design, so section 1 is the hardware-capable surface and a test here is worth
 * double. Every message is built by the kit and put on the in-process bus.
 *
 * WHAT THE DEVICE ACTUALLY STORES, because it is not a private key in any format
 * a client library will hand you:
 *
 *   The slot holds P || Q and nothing else. `rsa_getpub()` (okcrypto.cpp:1216)
 *   multiplies the two halves to get N on every load, and `rsa_sign()` /
 *   `rsa_decrypt()` recompute D, DP, DQ and QP from them - with E HARDCODED to
 *   0x10001. So a key whose public exponent is not 65537 can be stored happily
 *   and will then sign with a D derived from an exponent it does not have.
 *   node:crypto's RSA keygen uses 65537, as does every other generator in
 *   practice, but nothing on the wire says so.
 *
 *   `type` is the modulus size in units of 128 bytes - 1, 2, 3, 4 for 1024,
 *   2048, 3072, 4096 - and it shares one byte with the feature flags: the low
 *   nibble is the size, bit 5 is decrypt, bit 6 is sign. python-onlykey's
 *   `setkey()` folds them the same way.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENT CHUNK FRAMINGS IN ONE FILE, which is the trap here. They look
 * alike and byte 6 means something different in each:
 *
 *   The KEY going in (OKSETPRIV -> rsa_priv_flash, okcore.cpp:5480) carries the
 *   TYPE BYTE in buffer[6] on every one of the five reports, and the firmware
 *   copies a fixed 57 bytes from each regardless of how much the report really
 *   held. It counts its own way to 256 with a global offset. That is exactly
 *   what python-onlykey's `setkey()` sends - five slices of 114 hex characters
 *   for RSA-2048, nine for RSA-4096.
 *
 *   The OPERATION payload (OKSIGN / OKDECRYPT -> process_packets,
 *   okcore.cpp:7419) carries the CONTINUATION MARKER in buffer[6]: 0xFF while
 *   more follows, and the final chunk's own length on the last one. Send the
 *   type byte here and the packet is accumulated as if 0xFF meant 255 bytes;
 *   send 0xFF as a key type and the load is rejected as an invalid RSA type.
 *
 * THE SINGLE-PRESS CHALLENGE MODE COVERS RSA SLOTS TOO, which is not obvious and
 * is not written down anywhere else. `done_process_packets()` loads
 * `stored_key_challenge_mode` when the slot is `< 5` OR in 101..116 - and `< 5`
 * IS the RSA slot range. So the byte-1 trick 14-stored-keys established works
 * here unchanged, and for the same reason: the press handler's clause tests
 * `stored_key_challenge_mode == 1` exactly, so the character '1' (0x31) primes a
 * confirmation that no press can then answer.
 *
 * WHAT EACH ANSWER IS CHECKED AGAINST. Nothing here trusts the device twice:
 *
 *   the modulus     against OpenSSL's own N for the same key, and against
 *                   P * Q multiplied out here in BigInt
 *   the signature   verified by node:crypto against a public key built from the
 *                   modulus THE DEVICE PUBLISHED, not from the host's key object
 *   the plaintext   sealed by node:crypto to that same published modulus, so a
 *                   device that decrypted with the wrong key returns noise
 *
 * SURFACES - see PRODUCTION.md. The vendor interface carries every answer and
 * every refusal, so the whole file survives into a production walk bar the press
 * timing: the console is read for "Encrypted Buffer" only, because the device
 * gives a client no signal that it has finished priming a confirmation, and a
 * press that lands during the fade is discarded silently. Where a test asserts
 * that NO confirmation was primed, that count is console-only for the same
 * reason and is a secondary assertion - the vendor error text is the primary one.

       * is not a key, and is certainly not the one that was wiped.
