/*
 * The multi-report response path: does a large answer arrive whole, and in order?
 *
 * NOT `OKGETRESPONSE`. TODO put that first in the work order for several
 * sessions on the premise that "every large payload comes back through it"; it
 * has no handler, no references, and every client has it absent or commented
 * out. See PLAN's plane 1. Nothing is requested per chunk - the device pushes:
 *
 *     send_transport_response()      okcore.cpp:2821
 *     for (int i = 0; i < len; i += 64) { memcpy(resp_buffer, data+i, ...);
 *                                         RawHID.send2(resp_buffer, 100); }
 *
 * So a large response is N consecutive unsolicited 64-byte reports and the host
 * simply reads until it has enough. That path is exercised constantly and
 * tested nowhere directly - only sideways, by features that would blame
 * themselves if it broke.
 *
 * IT HAS A RECORDED FAILURE MODE, which is what makes this worth a file rather
 * than a footnote. The comment at the fix site in okcore.cpp says it plainly:
 * `RawHID.send2(buf, 0)` gives up almost instantly when the firmware's
 * four-packet TX queue is still full, returning 0 WITHOUT SENDING - and that
 * return value was never checked, so a full queue silently dropped a chunk. It
 * is called the root cause of the intermittent truncated multi-packet responses
 * seen all session. The fix gives each attempt a 100ms budget and retries five
 * times.
 *
 * A queue that fills is likelier to fill LATE than early, so the long response
 * matters more than the short one. Both are driven:
 *
 *     1184 bytes   ML-KEM-768 public key      19 reports
 *     3309 bytes   ML-DSA-65 signature        52 reports
 *
 * and the assertion in each case is the same three things: the whole length
 * arrived, it arrived as the expected number of reports, and the bytes are the
 * ones the device meant to send rather than a tail of zeros where a chunk went
 * missing. A dropped chunk in the middle shifts everything after it; a dropped
 * chunk at the end truncates. Both are caught by comparing against a value that
 * can be checked independently.
 *
 * SURFACES - see PRODUCTION.md. This is the vendor interface throughout. The
 * console is used for one thing only, and it is the unavoidable one: reading
 * the button challenge the device raises for a keygen and for a signature, which
 * no client-visible surface reports.
 *
 * SECTION 1, so no kernel device node and no CLI. Every message here is built
 * by the kit and put on the in-process bus, which is also the point - this is
 * the first file to send OKSETPRIV and OKSIGN by hand rather than through
 * onlykey-cli or the web app's library.
