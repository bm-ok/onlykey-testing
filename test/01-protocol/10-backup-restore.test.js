/*
 * The encrypted backup, created and restored.
 *
 * This is the test the emulator was built for. The old kit could not do it and
 * said so in as many words (onlykey-alpha-testing/test/08-backup-hmac.test.js):
 *
 *   a full backup-create -> restore round-trip isn't testable from this repo -
 *   there is no backup-file *creation* command anywhere in python-onlykey's
 *   client.py or CLI (only restore_from_backup(), which *consumes* a backup
 *   file); producing one is a closed-source OnlyKey-App/DUO-hardware feature
 *   this harness has no access to.
 *
 * It was never a closed-source feature. Creating a backup is the device TYPING
 * it - six hundred characters over the keyboard interface - and the old kit had
 * no way to read that, because on real hardware the keyboard is a device node
 * that needs elevated privileges and gives you every keystroke on the machine.
 * Here it is an event on a bus, which is exactly what EXPLAINER.md predicted
 * would "finally make backup and restore testable at all".
 *
 * Three firmware gates shape the order below, and none of them is obvious:
 *
 *   - The backup key is a private key in slot 131, and OKSETPRIV is refused
 *     outside config mode.
 *   - The backup itself CANNOT be taken in config mode. payload()'s backup
 *     branch requires !isfade, and config mode holds the LED in a permanent
 *     animation, so isfade never goes false. Configure, leave, then back up.
 *   - OKRESTORE is refused outside config mode. So config mode is entered
 *     twice, with a normal-mode window in the middle where the backup happens.
