/*
 * The FIDO2 interface does not answer while the device is in CONFIG MODE.
 *
 * That is this file's claim and it is PINNED, not merely observed - see the
 * assertions in the third test. WebAuthn and U2F are both unavailable to a user
 * who has put the device in config mode, which means a login that would
 * otherwise work simply does not, with no error from the device: the endpoint
 * is silent rather than refusing. Written up in
 * FINDING-fido-silent-in-config-mode.md.
 *
 * By source-read it should be the opposite: `configmode` appears nowhere in
 * `libraries/fido2/` at all, and okcore.cpp's config-mode allow-list at line
 * 347 filters the RAW-HID dispatch (`process_packets`), which is a different
 * entry point from `bridge_to_onlykey()`. The source read was wrong, which is
 * the reason to measure rather than reason about this firmware's cross-path
 * globals - `pending_operation` and `packet_buffer_details[3]` are both
 * rewritten by the raw-HID pipeline while a FIDO2 request is in flight.
 *
 * It also settles a design question that is now parked: a browser cannot load a
 * key onto the device, because loading needs config mode and config mode has no
 * WebAuthn. That holds regardless of which command the bridge might grow.
 *
 * TWO LAYERS, because they can fail separately and only one of them is the
 * interesting answer:
 *
 *   1. plain CTAP2 (init / getInfo / getAssertion) - is the FIDO stack alive?
 *   2. the OnlyKey BRIDGE (OKCONNECT through onlykey-api.js) - is
 *      `bridge_to_onlykey()` reachable, which is the path a load would use?
 *
 * A pass at layer 1 and a failure at layer 2 would be the finding; a failure at
 * layer 1 makes layer 2 moot.
 *
 * This file asserts CAPABILITY, not that anything should be loaded. It writes
 * no keys and leaves config mode by reboot, which is the only way out of it.
 *
 * SURFACE: FIDO (0xF1D0) throughout, plus the keyboard surface to enter config
 * mode. Both survive into a production walk.
