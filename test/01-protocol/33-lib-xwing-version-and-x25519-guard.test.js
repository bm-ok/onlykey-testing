/*
 * node-onlykey-lib's okcrypto, against the real firmware: X-Wing asks the
 * version first (lib 204bd28), and a low-order X25519 point never leaves the
 * host (lib 267d199).
 *
 * WHY AGAINST THE FIRMWARE when the lib already tests both. The lib's tests run
 * on its fake firmware, which answers what the lib's author believes the
 * firmware answers. The two claims here are both about what the REAL device
 * says when nobody has told the lib anything:
 *
 *   - a LOCKED key answers OKCONNECT with INITIALIZED and no version. The X-Wing
 *     fix rests entirely on that reply having no version in it, and on the lib
 *     then refusing (XWING_VERSION_UNKNOWN) instead of guessing the pre-3.0.5
 *     64-byte shape. If 3.1.0 ever put its version in the locked reply, the
 *     refusal would never fire - and nothing in the lib's suite would notice.
 *   - an UNLOCKED key nobody connected: the lib must learn 3.1.0 over the vendor
 *     interface and take the custody shape. Before the fix it read "unknown" as
 *     "old" and sliced a 1216-byte recipient into a 64-byte pair - a valid-looking
 *     recipient of a key nobody holds, which no length check can see.
 *
 * THE ORACLE FOR THE SHAPE is a second stack on the same device that connected
 * FIRST, the path that was always right. Both run the same lib code; the claim
 * of G-6 is precisely that "nobody connected" and "connected" now give the same
 * recipient. Under the bug they differ (the split recipient re-expands the
 * first 64 bytes of pk_M), so equality is the test, not a tautology.
 *
 * THE GUARD: v3.0.4 computes X25519 with whatever it is sent and answers a
 * 32-byte zero secret for a low-order point; only the host can refuse that on
 * the installed base. The control is the same call with a GOOD point, which
 * must reach the firmware, be confirmed and agree with node:crypto - only then
 * does "the low-order ones never reached it" mean anything.
 *
 * SURFACES: the lib composed over the kit's in-process emulator
 * (lib/libstack.js, transport/embedded) - vendor and FIDO, no gadget, so this
 * runs on Windows. The challenge press goes through the firmware's debug
 * button harness like every other press in section 1.
