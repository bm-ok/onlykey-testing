/*
 * The second profile: the PIN this kit provisions on every single run and had
 * never once used.
 *
 * `PINS.secondary` appeared exactly once in the whole suite before this file,
 * in `07-unlock`, and only as a NEGATIVE assertion - "the wrong PIN must not be
 * this one". Every run set it up and no run ever entered it. That is the worst
 * shape a feature can be in: provisioned, so it looks covered, and unexercised,
 * so a break in it is invisible.
 *
 * WHAT THE SECOND PROFILE ACTUALLY IS, from `password.cpp`'s
 * profile2hashevaluate(). On a match it reads `2ndprofilemode` out of EEPROM: if
 * it is not NONENCRYPTEDPROFILE it unwraps the profile key and sets
 * `profilemode = STDPROFILE2`; if it is, it sets `profilemode =
 * NONENCRYPTEDPROFILE` and derives no key at all.
 *
 * That second branch is NOT what this file is about, and the distinction matters
 * enough to state before anything else - see README's "STD_VERSION" note.
 * NONENCRYPTEDPROFILE is primarily a BUILD: `setup()` assigns it in the `#else`
 * of `#ifdef STD_VERSION` (OnlyKey.ino:259-263), which is the International
 * Travel Edition, and that edition exists because some countries do not permit
 * encrypted devices. A legal constraint, not a security feature. Plausible
 * deniability is that build's property. Everything below is the STD build, which
 * is the only one this kit has ever compiled or run.
 *
 * So what the second profile gives you in an STD build is ONE thing, and this
 * file is the two halves of it:
 *
 *   IT IS A DIFFERENT SET OF SLOTS. `gen_press()` in OnlyKey.ino computes
 *   `slot = (button_selected - '0') + 12` when `profilemode` is set, and
 *   `gen_hold()` the same plus six - so the second profile's buttons address
 *   slots 13..24 and can never address 1..12. Twelve slots per profile,
 *   twenty-four in total.
 *
 *   IT IS NOT A DIFFERENT KEY, and the third test pins that. Slot passwords are
 *   sealed with `okcore_aes_gcm_encrypt(..., profilekey, ...)` (okcore.cpp:1778),
 *   and both profiles unwrap the SAME stored 32-byte master profile key -
 *   deliberately, so that a PIN change does not have to re-derive one. Measured,
 *   not reasoned: an AES-GCM decrypt of profile 1's ciphertext succeeds in
 *   profile 2 and the firmware prints the plaintext as it does it. Evidence in
 *   the third test's header.
 *
 * The row this file answers asked to "confirm it cannot see profile 1's [slot
 * data]". It can, and that premise is now in TODO's table with the other
 * disproven ones - but the correction is to the RECORD, not to the firmware.
 * Separation by slot numbering is what the second profile is documented to be.
 *
 * NAMED AFTER PINS AND SLOTS RATHER THAN MESSAGES. Every other section-1 file
 * names its tests after the endpoint they cover, because the subject is a
 * message. Here the subject is a PRESS path - `gen_press()` and the profile
 * dispatch above it - so the names carry the PIN and the slot number instead,
 * which is the thing that has to be greppable to debug one of these alone.
 *
 * ESTABLISHED, NEVER INHERITED, and here that costs a reboot per test rather
 * than the usual read-first shortcut. `ensureUnlocked()` cannot be used at all:
 * it reads the status, sees `unlocked`, and returns - and an unlocked device
 * says nothing about WHICH PROFILE it is unlocked into, so a test that accepted
 * it would assert about whichever profile its predecessor happened to leave
 * open. Every test here restarts and enters its own PIN.
 *
 * SURFACES - see PRODUCTION.md. The KEYBOARD surface carries every assertion
 * about what the device holds, which is the strongest oracle in the kit and
 * survives into a production walk whole: what a slot contains is proven by
 * reading what the device TYPES, not by an acknowledgement that a write was
 * accepted. The vendor interface carries the writes and the unlock
 * announcement. The console is not read at all.

       * the expectation - so it FAILS if the profiles are ever given separate
       * keys, which is the notice a reader would want.
       *
       * The measurement, printed by the firmware itself on the first run of this
       * file, when the assertion was still the other way round:
       *
       *     INPUT KEY         85 E7 A9 F7 …      the key profile 2 read with
       *     SLOT              13
       *     ENCRYPTED STATE   E6 C2 DD 70 …      sealed while in profile 1
       *     DECRYPTED STATE   70 72 6F 66 69 …   "profileONEsecret1"
       *
       * An AES-GCM decrypt that SUCCEEDS across the profile boundary can only
       * mean one key, and okcore.cpp:1778 is where the seal happens.
       *
       * WHY IT IS ONE KEY, from `password.cpp`'s two unwrap paths. The device
       * stores ONE random 32-byte master profile key and wraps it for each PIN
       * - `okcore_flashset_profilekey()` for the primary, its counterpart for the
       * second - and profile2hashevaluate() unwraps that same blob with a KEK
       * derived from ITS shared secret. The comment at that branch says why:
       * "Using new method, PIN changes supported". A per-profile key would have
       * to be re-derived on every PIN change; a wrapped master does not. The
       * backwards-compatible path beside it - `Curve25519::eval(profilekey, KEK,
       * p1hash)` - is the one that gives profile 2 a key of its own, and it only
       * runs when no stored profile key is found.
       *
       * SO THE SECOND PROFILE'S SEPARATION IS BY SLOT NUMBERING, NOT BY
       * CRYPTOGRAPHY, and the first two tests are what that separation actually
       * consists of. Two things bound the exposure and are worth stating so this
       * is not read as more alarming than it is: gen_press() and gen_hold()
       * ALWAYS add 12 in the second profile, so a second-profile user cannot
       * press their way to slots 1..12 at all; and no client message reads a
       * password back out, so the vendor interface does not offer a way either.
       * Reaching across takes a slot both profiles can address - which is what
       * this test arranges, and what a client configuring all 24 slots from one
       * unlocked session would arrange too.
       *
       * The controls are unchanged in purpose. Control A proves the write path
       * and the seal are working in the session that wrote them, so the
       * cross-profile read below is a read of real ciphertext; control B proves
       * button 1 in the second profile really does select slot 13, so a pass
       * here cannot be the press landing somewhere else.
