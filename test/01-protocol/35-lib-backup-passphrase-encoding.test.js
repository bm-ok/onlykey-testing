/*
 * node-onlykey-lib's backup passphrase encoding (N-1, owner's decision
 * 2026-09-30), against the real firmware: a passphrase is hashed as UTF-8 from
 * lib 0.4.0 on, and restore({ passphrase }) falls back to the classic App's
 * Latin-1 hash by itself.
 *
 * WHY AGAINST THE FIRMWARE. The firmware never sees the passphrase - only the
 * 32-byte hash in slot 131 - so which encoding made a backup is invisible to
 * it. What the lib relies on is something else: that it can tell, on the host,
 * whether the device will ACCEPT a backup under a given key. It has to,
 * because the device cannot be asked twice - RESTORE answers a wrong key with
 * "Error incorrect backup key set" and restarts (okcore.cpp:6630-6636), and a
 * second attempt needs the PIN and config mode entered on the key again. The
 * lib's suite proves its prediction against a fake written from the lib
 * author's reading of okcore.cpp; this file proves it against the device:
 *
 *   the premise   the device refuses an old backup under the UTF-8 key, in
 *                 its own words, and restarts - sent RAW, no lib involved;
 *   old backup    protected the OLD way (the Latin-1 hash of "pässword...",
 *                 set raw, exactly as the classic App sets it) restores
 *                 through the lib, which reports 'latin-1-legacy';
 *   new backup    protected by the lib's own setBackupPassphrase (UTF-8)
 *                 restores, reported 'utf-8';
 *   wrong         a wrong passphrase is refused with NOTHING sent.
 *
 * Each restore is checked by the slot label coming back, not by the lib's
 * return value alone.
 *
 * SURFACES: the lib over the kit's in-process emulator (lib/libstack.js),
 * vendor + keyboard capture; presses through the debug button harness.
