/*
 * Classic RSA over the WebAuthn tunnel, at the 512-byte boundary.
 *
 * THE LEAD. The alpha report's `ctap_end_get_assertion()` finding ends: "It also
 * affects the classic RSA path, which shares this transport, for any response
 * served in more than one chunk." Written as a prediction and never verified.
 * This drives it.
 *
 * The bug it refers to sized a WebAuthn response from `pending_operation`, a
 * global that `process_packets()` rewrites on every inbound raw-HID packet -
 * including the polls being answered. When the gate failed the assertion fell to
 * a 72-byte default while the cursor advanced a full 512, so the host got one
 * byte in seven. **A response that fits one chunk is immune**, because that path
 * finishes inside `send_stored_response()`, which sets `pending_operation` itself
 * before returning. So the failure split by response SIZE and looked exactly
 * like a buffer-capacity bug.
 *
 * WHY 512 IS THE NUMBER TO DRIVE, and why an RSA-2048 signature is NOT the
 * multi-chunk case the lead assumed. The chunk is `MAX_LARGE_RESP_CHUNK` = 512
 * (ok_extension.cpp:116) - not a 64-byte HID report. A classic RSA response is
 * `type * 128` and `store_FIDO_response()` does not grow it
 * (`large_resp_buffer_offset = len`, and the box is length-preserving), so:
 *
 *     RSA-1024   128 B     RSA-3072   384 B
 *     RSA-2048   256 B     RSA-4096   512 B   <- exactly one full chunk
 *
 * `chunk_len = remaining > MAX_LARGE_RESP_CHUNK ? MAX_LARGE_RESP_CHUNK :
 * remaining`, so on a reading of the code even 512 is served whole. **That is
 * exactly what reading cannot be trusted for**: 512 is simultaneously
 * MAX_LARGE_RESP_CHUNK and MAX_RSA_KEY_SIZE, and one `>` that should be `>=`, or
 * a cursor compared before it is advanced, splits it into 512 + 0 and puts the
 * host back in the 71-bytes-per-chunk failure. So RSA-4096 is driven first and
 * RSA-2048 second.
 *
 * THE CLIENT HAD TO BE BUILT, and `lib/device/transit.js` is where it went.
 * `tunnel.js` alone cannot reach any command but OKCONNECT:
 * `bridge_to_onlykey()` runs `okcrypto_aes_crypto_box()` over the whole payload
 * before it looks at the command, so an unencrypted request is dispatched as
 * noise. Written in the kit rather than borrowed from the shipped library
 * deliberately - `03-xwing-derive` lets the library send its option bytes because
 * the library IS its subject, and here the subject is the firmware's chunking, so
 * a second client would just be testing the library again. It also keeps this
 * file in section 1, where a test is worth double.
 *
 * HOW THE TWO HALVES ARE TOLD APART, which matters because a wrong transit key
 * and a chunking bug both end in "the signature does not verify":
 *
 *   the REQUEST   is proven by the device's own console dump - it prints
 *                 "Received Message" and the bytes it is about to hash, so the
 *                 test asserts the device received exactly the digest that was
 *                 sent. That is the transit box working, independent of any
 *                 response.
 *   the RESPONSE  is then the only remaining variable, and it is checked by
 *                 verifying the signature against the modulus the device
 *                 published over the vendor interface.
 *
 * SURFACES - see PRODUCTION.md. The FIDO interface carries the whole operation
 * and the vendor interface carries the key setup and the modulus, so the
 * assertions are client-visible. The console is read for two things that no
 * client surface reports: when the confirmation has primed, and which bytes the
 * device received. The second is the request/response discriminator above and is
 * the reason this file can attribute a failure at all.
