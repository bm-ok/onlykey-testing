/*
 * The self-destruct PIN: the other one this kit provisioned on every run and had
 * never entered.
 *
 * Like `PINS.secondary`, `PINS.selfDestruct` appeared exactly once in the whole
 * suite before this file - in `07-unlock`, as a NEGATIVE assertion saying the
 * wrong PIN must never be this one. Every run set it up; no run ever typed it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, and why the gate is not optional. OnlyKey.ino's press handler
 * reaches `password.sdhashevaluate()` only after profile 1 and profile 2 have
 * both failed to match, and on a match it calls `factorydefault()` - which
 * erases EEPROM and flash, erases the FIRMWARE HASH, and restarts. On a physical
 * key that last part is the expensive one: it forces the bootloader, so the key
 * needs reflashing before it is a key again.
 *
 * So this file carries `full-wipe`, the same capability `device.wipe({full})`
 * checks. It is free on the emulator and, on hardware, false unless somebody
 * sets `OKT_ALLOW_FULL_WIPE=yes` - which is the opt-in that says "I can reflash
 * this key". The capability's own reason string says exactly that, which is why
 * this file reuses it rather than inventing a second gate meaning the same thing.
 * DO NOT weaken it: a hardware run that reaches this file without the opt-in is
 * supposed to skip with that reason printed.
 *
 * ORDER OF THE THREE PIN CHECKS IS THE THING THAT MAKES THIS TESTABLE AT ALL.
 * The self-destruct branch is an `else` after both profile evaluations, so it can
 * only fire on a PIN that is neither profile's. That is also why `lib/config.js`
 * insists all three test PINs are distinct: a repeat would be swallowed by an
 * earlier branch and this file would wipe nothing while appearing to pass.
 *
 * SURFACES - see PRODUCTION.md. The vendor interface carries the status reads
 * (the once-a-second broadcast is how a locked or uninitialized device answers
 * at all) and the keyboard interface carries the second test's assertion. The
 * console is not read. So both tests survive into a production walk, which is
 * worth having: this is the one behaviour a production key must get right and
 * cannot be asked about twice.
