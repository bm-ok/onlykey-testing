/*
 * Stored keys: OKGETPUBKEY, OKSIGN and OKDECRYPT across all six key types.
 *
 * Every one of those three messages dispatches on the SLOT number, and until
 * now only the two RESERVED derivation slots had ever been sent - 132 for
 * SSH/GPG and 128 for the web derivation. The stored-slot branches, the ones
 * that read a key out of flash, had never been reached by any of the three.
 * That is where all six key types live, and where a bug sits on a user's real
 * key material rather than on something reproducible from a label.
 *
 * SECTION 1 ON PURPOSE. Section 2 can never run against a physical key and
 * section 3's headless tier drives the emulator by design, so section 1 is the
 * only place a test is worth double - it is the hardware-capable surface. Every
 * message here is built by the kit and put on the in-process bus; no CLI, no
 * plugin, no browser, no kernel device node.
 *
 * THE CHALLENGE-MODE BLOCKER, WHICH THIS FILE CLEARS
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * README has listed crypto vectors against stored keys as not built, blocked on
 * "challenge-mode configuration that has not been worked out". It is worked out
 * here, and it is two facts:
 *
 *   1. `stored_key_challenge_mode` = 1 turns the three-digit challenge into a
 *      SINGLE press of ANY button. done_process_packets() sets CRYPTO_AUTH = 3
 *      instead of computing Challenge_button1/2/3, and the press handler in
 *      OnlyKey.ino has a clause - `(stored_key_challenge_mode==1 && isfade &&
 *      packet_buffer_details[0])` - that jumps straight to CRYPTO_AUTH = 4
 *      without comparing which button was pressed.
 *
 *   2. IT MUST BE SENT AS THE BYTE 1, NOT THE CHARACTER '1'. The clause tests
 *      `== 1` exactly. Sending the string puts 0x31 in EEPROM, which is truthy
 *      enough for done_process_packets() to set CRYPTO_AUTH = 3 - so the device
 *      primes, and looks like it is waiting for one press - and then no press
 *      satisfies the clause, and the operation answers "Error incorrect
 *      challenge". That cost the first run of this file and is exactly the shape
 *      of thing that made the row look unworkable.
 *
 * Worth knowing next door: `03-gui/02-derive` sets the DERIVED mode with
 * `String(8)`, which is 0x38. That happens to work, because the tunnelled path
 * tests `is_bit_set(mode, 3)` and 0x38 has bit 3 set. It is right by accident,
 * and it would not survive being changed to any other value.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TYPE IS CHECKED AGAINST, because "the device answered" is not a
 * result. Nothing here trusts the device twice:
 *
 *   ed25519      pubkey and signature against node:crypto
 *   nist256p1    pubkey and signature against node:crypto
 *   secp256k1    pubkey and signature against node:crypto
 *   curve25519   shared secret against node:crypto's X25519
 *   ML-KEM-768   shared secret against @noble's encapsulation
 *   X-Wing       shared secret against @noble's encapsulation
 *
 * The three classic curves and X25519 need nothing but node:crypto. The two PQC
 * types need @noble, so they carry `xwing-math` and skip with a reason without
 * it - which is why they are separate tests rather than one loop.
 *
 * SURFACES - see PRODUCTION.md. Vendor throughout for every answer. The console
 * is read for one thing only and it is unavoidable: knowing WHEN the device has
 * primed a confirmation, so the press lands after the fade rather than during
 * it. Nothing is read from it that a client could have been told.
