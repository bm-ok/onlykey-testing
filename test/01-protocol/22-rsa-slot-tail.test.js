/*
 * The RSA slot tail: does a smaller key stored after a larger one is READ leave
 * the larger one's plaintext in flash?
 *
 * This file exists to answer a question that was raised by reading and must not
 * be settled that way. `19-rsa-keys` turned up the shape of it and deliberately
 * left it alone; this measures it, and measures the two halves SEPARATELY,
 * because they are different severities and conflating them would overstate the
 * finding:
 *
 *   1. Is the previous key's plaintext actually present in flash?
 *   2. Is any of it reachable through a normal device operation, rather than
 *      only by reading raw flash?
 *
 * THE MECHANISM UNDER TEST, so the measurement can be checked against a
 * prediction rather than fished for. Three sites in `rsa_priv_flash()` and
 * `okcore_flashget_RSA()` (okcore.cpp):
 *
 *   a. `okcore_flashget_RSA()` decrypts a stored key IN PLACE into the
 *      `rsa_private_key` global - so after any READ of an RSA slot, that global
 *      holds `type * 128` bytes of somebody's private key in the clear.
 *   b. `rsa_priv_flash()` accumulates a new key into the SAME global, and only
 *      as far as the new key goes: the chunk guard for a 1024-bit key stops at
 *      offset 114, so bytes past 171 are never written.
 *   c. It then encrypts only `keysize` bytes - `okcore_aes_gcm_encrypt(...,
 *      keysize)` - and copies **all MAX_RSA_KEY_SIZE (512)** bytes of the global
 *      into the flash sector. Everything past `keysize` goes to flash exactly as
 *      it sat in RAM.
 *
 * So the prediction, for a 2048-bit key read and then a 1024-bit key stored:
 *
 *   flash slot-B region, offset 0..127     E(B), the new key, encrypted
 *   flash slot-B region, offset 128..170   the third chunk's report padding
 *   flash slot-B region, offset 171..255   *** key A's PLAINTEXT, bytes 171..255
 *   flash slot-B region, offset 256..511   whatever the global held before
 *
 * A's P||Q is P at 0..127 and Q at 128..255, so bytes 171..255 are the LOW 85
 * bytes of A's 128-byte Q. That is the number that decides how bad this is, and
 * it is why the test reports the run length rather than just "found": known low
 * bits of one factor is the Coppersmith setting, and 85 of 128 bytes is far past
 * the half-the-bits threshold that attack needs. A reader of this file should
 * take the length seriously and not just the boolean.
 *
 * WHY IT NEEDS THE READ IN THE MIDDLE. Without step (a) the global holds only
 * zeros from boot, and the tail written to flash is a tail of zeros - which is
 * why this went unnoticed and why `19-rsa-keys` does not trip it. The read is
 * not exotic: `OKGETPUBKEY` does it, and so does every `OKSIGN` and `OKDECRYPT`,
 * because all three call `okcore_flashget_RSA()` first.
 *
 * SURFACES - see PRODUCTION.md. The first test's oracle is `flash.bin` itself,
 * which is not a client-visible surface at all: it is the emulator's backing
 * store, so this file carries `storage-files` and is emulated-only BY ITS
 * SUBJECT rather than by convenience. That is exactly the point of separating
 * the two questions - test 1 says the bytes are there, and only something with
 * raw flash access can see them. The second test is on the vendor surface and
 * says the device itself will not hand them over.
