# Finding: an RSA slot's unused tail carries the previous key's plaintext to flash

**Status:** measured on the emulator, reproducible, `libraries@83353cf`.
**Severity:** confidentiality of key material **at rest**. Not remotely
reachable - see "What it is NOT", which is as load-bearing as the rest.
**Reproducer:** `onlykey-testing`, `01-protocol/22-rsa-slot-tail.test.js`,
which measures both halves separately and fails if either changes.

## Summary

Storing an RSA key writes **512 bytes** to the slot's flash region but encrypts
only as many as the new key occupies. The rest of that 512 bytes is whatever
happened to be left in the `rsa_private_key` global - and reading any RSA slot
leaves *that slot's private key, in the clear*, in exactly that global.

So: read a 2048-bit key, then store a 1024-bit key, and **85 contiguous plaintext
bytes of the 2048-bit key's prime Q are written to flash**, unencrypted, inside
the 1024-bit key's slot.

Measured, not inferred:

```
longest contiguous run of key A's P||Q in flash: 85 bytes, key offset 171
that run sits 171 bytes into a 512-byte slot stride
longest run of key B's own P||Q (the key being stored): 0 bytes
```

Key offset 171 is inside Q (P is bytes 0..127, Q is 128..255), so the residue is
**the low 85 bytes of the 128-byte prime Q**. That is well past the half-the-bits
threshold at which Coppersmith's method recovers a factor from partial knowledge,
so an attacker who can read the flash region can factor the modulus. Key B being
absent from the clear text confirms this is a tail-of-buffer defect and *not* the
slot encryption failing.

## The three lines that do it

All in `libraries/onlykey/okcore.cpp`.

**1. Reading a slot leaves plaintext in a global.** `okcore_flashget_RSA()`
decrypts in place:

```c
okcore_flashget_common((uint8_t *)rsa_private_key, (unsigned long *)adr, (type * 128));
okcore_aes_gcm_decrypt(rsa_private_key, slot, features, profilekey, (type * 128));
```

After this, `rsa_private_key[0 .. type*128-1]` is a private key in the clear.
`OKGETPUBKEY`, `OKSIGN` and `OKDECRYPT` all call it, so any use of an RSA slot
does this.

**2. Storing a smaller key only overwrites as far as it goes.**
`rsa_priv_flash()` accumulates into the same global, and its chunk guard stops
early for a smaller key - for `keysize == 128` the guard is
`packet_buffer_offset <= 114`, so nothing past offset 171 is ever written:

```c
else if ((buffer[6] & 0x0F) == 1)   //Expect 128 Bytes
{
    keysize = 128;
    if (buffer[0] != 0xBA && packet_buffer_offset <= 114)
    {
        memcpy(rsa_private_key + packet_buffer_offset, buffer + 7, 57);
        packet_buffer_offset = packet_buffer_offset + 57;
    }
}
```

**3. It then encrypts `keysize` bytes and writes `MAX_RSA_KEY_SIZE`.** This is
the defect:

```c
okcore_aes_gcm_encrypt(rsa_private_key, buffer[5], buffer[6], profilekey, keysize);   /* 128 */
okcore_flashget_common(tptr, (unsigned long *)adr, 2048);
for (int z = 0; z < MAX_RSA_KEY_SIZE; z++)                                           /* 512 */
{
    temp[z + ((buffer[5] * MAX_RSA_KEY_SIZE) - MAX_RSA_KEY_SIZE)] = rsa_private_key[z];
}
flashEraseSector((unsigned long *)adr);
okcore_flashset_common(tptr, (unsigned long *)adr, 2048);
```

`keysize` bytes are protected; bytes `keysize .. 511` go to flash exactly as they
sat in RAM.

## Resulting layout, for a 1024-bit key stored after a 2048-bit key was read

| slot region offset | content |
|---|---|
| 0..127 | the new key, AES-GCM encrypted - correct |
| 128..170 | zero padding from the third 57-byte report |
| **171..255** | **the previous key's plaintext, bytes 171..255 - the low 85 bytes of its Q** |
| 256..511 | whatever the global held before |

## Preconditions, which bound it

- **Both operations must happen within one boot.** The residue lives in RAM.
  A reboot re-runs `setup()`, the C++ globals are reconstructed, and
  `rsa_private_key` comes back zeroed - so a read in one boot and a write in the
  next leaks nothing. (This produced a false negative in the first version of the
  test, which is why it is stated.)
- **The write must be for a smaller key than the read.** Same-size or larger
  overwrites the residue.
- Entering config mode does **not** reboot - the long-press-6 branch sets
  `configmode = true`, clears `unlocked` and returns - so "read a slot, then enter
  config mode and store a smaller key" is a single-boot sequence a client can
  perform. That is the realistic path: a configuration tool that reads slots to
  display them and then writes one.

## What it is NOT - measured, and it limits the severity

**The residue is not reachable through the device's own interfaces.** Every
reader of an RSA slot is bounded by the slot's declared type:

- `okcore_flashget_RSA()` reads exactly `type * 128` bytes, and `OKGETPUBKEY`,
  `OKSIGN` and `OKDECRYPT` all go through it. Measured: after arranging the leak,
  the 1024-bit slot answers `OKGETPUBKEY` in **2 reports** (128 bytes, its
  declared size) and those bytes contain **0 bytes** of the other key's material.
- The **backup** path is bounded by the same expression -
  `memcpy(large_temp + off + 3, rsa_private_key, (type * 128))` in `backup()`'s
  RSA loop. *This one is read from the source, not measured, and is stated as
  such.*
- The tail **cannot be promoted into readability.** Making the device read
  further would mean declaring a larger type for the slot, and
  `rsa_priv_flash()` only reaches `okeeprom_eeset_rsakey()` inside the branch
  that fires once the accumulated offset has passed the new key's size - i.e.
  only after a full-size write, which overwrites the residue first. Measured:
  85 bytes before promoting the slot to 2048-bit, **0 bytes after**.

So the exposure is to an attacker who can read flash directly - a physical
attacker with readout access, a firmware bug that dumps flash, or anyone handling
an image of the storage. On a Teensy 3.x that is what FSEC readout protection
exists to prevent. It is a defence-in-depth failure rather than a remote one.

## One thing to know before dumping a real key's flash

**OnlyKey's flash is not a flat byte image.** `okcore_flashset_common()` packs
each four bytes into one longword *big-endian* and writes it with
`flashProgramWord()`:

```c
unsigned long data = (uint8_t) * (ptr + z + 3) | ((uint8_t) * (ptr + z + 2) << 8)
                   | ((uint8_t) * (ptr + z + 1) << 16) | ((uint8_t) * (ptr + z) << 24);
```

On a little-endian core that puts `ptr[z]` at the *highest* address of the word,
so **every aligned 4-byte group is byte-reversed** relative to the logical bytes.
`okcore_flashget_common()` mirrors the unpack, so the device is self-consistent
and only an out-of-band reader sees it. Anyone reproducing this against a flash
dump must un-reverse each 4-byte word first, or every search comes back empty and
reads as "no leak". Verified against a slot label, which is stored in the clear:
`oktprobe00961683` was written and `borpkto00169386`-style word-reversed bytes
were on the medium; un-reversing gives the label back exactly.

## Suggested fix

Zero the unused tail before the flash copy, so nothing beyond the new key's own
material can ever be written:

```c
memset(rsa_private_key + keysize, 0, MAX_RSA_KEY_SIZE - keysize);
okcore_aes_gcm_encrypt(rsa_private_key, buffer[5], buffer[6], profilekey, keysize);
```

Wiping `rsa_private_key` after every `okcore_flashget_RSA()` consumer is finished
with it would also close it, and is the stronger form - the global holding a
plaintext private key between operations is the underlying condition, and the
same pattern exists for `ecc_private_key`, which this finding has not examined.

Note the same 512-byte copy is what makes an **RSA wipe** leave the slot's key
type in EEPROM (`rsa_priv_flash()` returns from its `wipe` branch before
`okeeprom_eeset_rsakey()`), so a wiped RSA slot still reports a key and publishes
a modulus computed from decrypted zeros. That is a separate finding, pinned by
`01-protocol/19-rsa-keys.test.js`.

## Reproducing

```sh
sudo sysctl -w vm.mmap_min_addr=4096
node bin/okt.js run test/01-protocol/22-rsa-slot-tail.test.js
```

Two tests: the first measures the residue, the second measures that it is not
reachable over the vendor interface. Both carry a control - the first proves the
flash image is current and correctly un-swapped before believing any absence, and
the second proves the bounded answer is a real answer rather than silence.
