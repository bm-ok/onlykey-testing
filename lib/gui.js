/*
 * gui.js - the two long-lived services section 3's browser tier needs, and a
 * CDP client to drive the window.
 *
 * Two processes, kept separate on purpose. The web app is an express server
 * (onlykey.github.io's own index.js, port 3000); nw.js is a Chromium that opens
 * pages against it and answers CDP on 9222. The old kit had nw.js spawn the
 * server as its own child, which is how a crashed browser left an orphan still
 * holding port 3000. Started separately, each one is a visible step that can be
 * seen to have run - and each is killed by PROCESS GROUP, because Chromium is a
 * tree and killing its leader leaves renderers behind.
 *
 * Neither is started by a hook. EXPLAINER is explicit about that: a wedge has to
 * stay attributable to a step somebody can point at, so 10-session starts these
 * and 19-stop stops them, and both appear in the run output like any other test.
 *
 * ORDERING THAT IS NOT OPTIONAL. The app's pages talk to the device as they
 * load. A page opened before the OnlyKey is unlocked has its startup OKCONNECT
 * time out, and Chromium then raises a NATIVE WebAuthn dialog - a real OS
 * window, outside the page, that no amount of CDP can dismiss. The session is
 * wedged from that point and only a restart clears it. So the device comes up
 * and unlocks first, and only then does anything open an app page. The landing
 * page in tools/nwjs makes no device call at all, which is why it is safe to
 * start on.
 *
 * The CDP client is Node's own global WebSocket - no dependency. Everything
 * here is optional-dependency shaped: with no nw binary the files skip with a
 * reason, the same as node-hid and the @noble packages.
