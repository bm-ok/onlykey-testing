/*
 * age-pqc.js - the derived (label-based) X-Wing split-custody maths, in JS.
 *
 * A port of python-onlykey's onlykey/age_plugin/derived_xwing.py, which is what
 * age-plugin-onlykey actually computes, and the twin of what the web app
 * computes in a browser. Three implementations have to agree byte for byte -
 * this one, the CLI's (kyber_py), and the firmware's
 * (okcrypto_xwing_web_derive(), okcrypto.cpp) - and a disagreement shows up as
 * "decryption failed" with no indication of which of the three is wrong.
 *
 * Split custody is the whole point: the device holds sk_X and never emits it.
 * What it emits is one X25519 shared secret and a one-way
 * SHA256(sk_X || tag)-derived ML-KEM seed the host expands locally, so neither
 * half can decrypt alone.
 *
 *   DERIVE_PUBLIC_KEY -> [ pk_X(32) | mlkem_seed(32) ]
 *   DERIVE_SHAREDSEC  -> [ ss_X(32) | mlkem_seed(32) ]
 *
 * This module reaches no device. It is the host half on its own, which is what
 * lets it be checked against a fixed vector in the sanity section, with no
 * device host, no gadget and no key - and, one day, what a real derive over the
 * WebAuthn tunnel will be checked AGAINST. Getting the maths pinned first is
 * what will make that debuggable: when the tunnelled derive command starts
 * answering, a mismatch is then the device's option bytes and not this file.
 *
 * The three @noble packages are optional dependencies and are loaded on first
 * use, not at require() time, so that a kit without them can still LOAD this
 * file and report a skip with a reason - the same arrangement as node-hid in
 * lib/device/hardware.js. See the 'xwing-math' capability.
 *
 * THE MATHS NOW COME FROM node-onlykey-lib (crypto.pqc - one lib, any GUI; the
 * test CLI is a GUI), whose age_pqc.js was ported from this file. The three
 * implementations that have to agree are now the library, the CLI's and the
 * firmware's - still three, still independent of one another. Checked before
 * the switch: the keypair from a seed, the recipient, the combiner, ctXOf,
 * splitDecapsulate (recovering the host's secret), recipient and identity
 * encoding - 13/13 identical - and bech32 20/20. The library is loaded on first
 * use too, so this file still loads, and probe() still answers, without it.
 * What stays here: probe() / PACKAGES (the kit's own dependency check) and the
 * three X25519 helpers that stand in for a device that is not there.
