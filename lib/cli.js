/*
 * cli.js - running the Python venv's binaries, for section 2.
 *
 * Section 2 tests what a REAL client does, which means running the real client:
 * onlykey-cli, onlykey-agent, age-plugin-onlykey, all out of the okpqc venv
 * beside this checkout. Nothing here reimplements the protocol - that is
 * section 1's job, and the point of having both is that they can disagree.
 *
 * Why this can share a device with the kit at all: with the USB gadget up, the
 * kit's device host holds /dev/hidg* (the device side of the link) and these
 * binaries open /dev/hidraw* (the host side). Opposite ends, different file
 * descriptors, no contention - which is what lets section 2 keep the fixture
 * isolation section 1 has. Against a PHYSICAL key that is not true: there the
 * kit's own adapter holds the same hidraw nodes the CLI wants, and they would
 * steal each other's reports.
