/*
 * initialized - all three PINs set, device rebooted, sitting locked.
 *
 * This is the firmware's out-of-box setup flow, driven the way OnlyKeyWizard.js
 * drives it on Classic hardware. Each PIN type is a four-message state machine
 * (okcore.cpp set_primary_pin / set_secondary_pin / set_sd_pin, states 0-3):
 *
 *   msg1 (arm)          -> "Enter PIN"
 *   [round 1 digits]
 *   msg2 (store)        -> validates and stores round 1, resets the buffer
 *   msg3 (arm-confirm)  -> "Confirm PIN"   (does NOT touch the buffer)
 *   [round 2 digits]
 *   msg4 (commit)       -> validates round 2 against round 1, commits
 *
 * Sending the messages is what advances it; there is no button press needed to
 * arm a state, and no waiting on the firmware's own 20-second inactivity timer.
 *
 * Every step waits on the firmware's own print for that step rather than on a
 * sleep. That is not a refinement, it is what makes the flow correct: the
 * device consumes injected digits at roughly 100ms each, so a 7-digit PIN takes
 * the better part of a second to land, and a fixed sleep let the "store"
 * message arrive mid-burst. The firmware then saw a 5-digit PIN, answered
 * "Error PIN is not between 7 - 10 digits", and the whole sequence ran to
 * completion having committed nothing.
 *
 * Each step also waits on its FAILURE print alongside its success print, so a
 * device that rejects something fails here, at the step that failed, in the
 * device's own wording - instead of surfacing eight seconds later as an
 * unexplained timeout.
