/*
 * device-host.js - the process the firmware actually runs in.
 *
 * This is the emulator's own bin/daemon.js with the gadget bridge and the
 * stdout tee taken out: require the emulator, start it against a storage dir,
 * run the existing IPC peer as the whole body, and write a restart marker
 * before dying.
 *
 * It is a separate process because it has to be. CPU_RESTART() ends the
 * firmware thread and start() cannot be called a second time in the same
 * process: okemu_hal_shutdown() never unmaps, so the second okemu_hal_init()
 * collides on MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE; re-arming the restart trap saves its own
 * handler as the "previous" one, which turns any later genuine crash into a
 * fault loop; the ThreadSafeFunctions leak; and the firmware's C++ globals were
 * constructed once at dlopen and never reconstruct. These tests reboot
 * constantly, so the test code cannot live here.
 *
 * Nothing is written to stdout in normal operation. The firmware is chatty in
 * DEBUG builds, and stdout is a pipe: if the parent ever stopped reading, this
 * process would block in write(), its event loop would stop, commands would go
 * unanswered, and the run would "hang" for a reason no watchdog could name.
 * Device output goes over IPC. stdout and stderr carry only this process's own
 * fatal reports - and the addon's segfault handler, which writes
 * "[okemu] FATAL: segfault at" plus a backtrace to stderr.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node device-host.js --socket PATH --storage DIR --markers DIR --generation N
