/*
 * pqc.js - driving age-plugin-onlykey's on-device key operations.
 *
 * Every PQC operation the CLI asks for is gated behind a three-button challenge
 * the device makes up on the spot, and the device's only way of telling a human
 * which buttons to press is its own LEDs. A test has no eyes, so it computes the
 * digits instead - which it can, because the challenge is a pure function of a
 * packet whose contents are known before it is sent.
 *
 *   ecc_priv_flash() (okcore.cpp:5264) sees an all-0xFF key body, recognises it
 *   as "generate on device", and - for ML-KEM and X-Wing only - primes a
 *   challenge over a 9-byte packet: [keytype, 0xFF x 8]. done_process_packets()
 *   SHA256s that packet and takes bytes 0, 15 and 31 mod 6, plus one.
 *
 * So the digits are knowable, and this file knows them. What is NOT knowable
 * ahead of time is WHEN to press: priming runs synchronously inside the
 * firmware's HID report handler, blocking loop() for the best part of a second,
 * and a press that arrives during that window is not queued - it is dropped.
 *
 * The old kit solved that by watching the CLI's own "Press OnlyKey button"
 * line - which fires before the device has even been asked - and then waiting a
 * fixed margin comfortably past the longest priming it had measured. It did
 * that because the device's own "Encrypted Buffer" print, which is the exact
 * end of the blocking window, arrives over DEBUG-serial, and on a real key under
 * load that channel drops output.
 *
 * Here it does not. The debug console is an in-process event, not a USB
 * interface being polled, so this waits for the device to say it has finished
 * rather than guessing how long finishing takes. That is the whole reason to
 * have an emulator: the instrument the hardware kit wanted was there all along,
 * it just could not be trusted through a cable.
