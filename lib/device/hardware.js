/*
 * hardware.js - the same test files, against a physical key.
 *
 * This is the other side of the seam described in lib/device/index.js. Three
 * differences are hidden here so that no test has to know which device it is
 * driving:
 *
 *   Report ID. hidraw takes the report ID as the first byte of every write and
 *   the proven client always prepends a zero. Payloads carry no report ID, so
 *   this adapter adds it. The emulator's delivery path pads to 64 and does not
 *   strip a leading report ID, so sending one there would put a different first
 *   byte on the wire from identical test code.
 *
 *   Padding. A hidraw reader must read the descriptor's declared count, so
 *   every SEREMU report arrives as a full 64 bytes with the tail zeroed. The
 *   emulated path emits exactly what the firmware wrote. So the NULs are
 *   stripped HERE and nowhere else - doing it on the emulated path would
 *   destroy legitimate NUL bytes in a binary report.
 *
 *   Restart as disappearance. A reboot on hardware is the device leaving the
 *   USB bus and coming back, not a child process exiting. Both present to a
 *   test as "the generation advanced".
 *
 * Selecting the right device is not a formality here. The emulator's USB
 * gadget presents 1d50:60fc, manufacturer CRYPTOTRUST, product ONLYKEY, serial
 * 1000000000 - byte for byte what a physical key presents, because that is the
 * entire point of the gadget. Nothing in the HID descriptors can tell them
 * apart. So selection is by sysfs: the gadget hangs off dummy_hcd and a real
 * key does not. Without that check a "hardware" run can quietly drive the
 * emulator and report a pass for a device that was never tested.

   * loop, leaving every handle it had already opened live and listening. Its
   * callers then retry - `_checkEnumeration()` sets `_present = false` and comes
   * back on the next tick, `writeHid()` reopens inline - and the retry called
   * `handles.set(iface, ...)` straight over a handle nobody had closed. The
   * orphan keeps its `data` listener, so SEREMU is delivered TWICE, and
   * `_genLog` accumulates two interleaved copies of the console.
   *
   * That is not hypothetical and it is not rare. A re-enumerating key races
   * udev: the new /dev/hidrawN nodes exist before the rules granting access to
   * them have been applied, so a reopen a few milliseconds too early fails with
   * EACCES *part way through the loop*.
   *
   * Measured 2026-08-06, run `20260806-124136`: 105 interface errors, 32 of them
   * EACCES, and console output arriving with whole blocks spliced into the
   * middle of other lines. `23-rsa-tunnel` read a 32-byte digest as 54 bytes and
   * failed. That is the one failure this explains, and the splice in that run's
   * failure block is the evidence for it.
   *
   * IT IS TIMING-DEPENDENT, NOT VOLUME-DEPENDENT, which is worth knowing before
   * anyone tries to predict it from a count: run `20260806-123045` logged 83
   * errors and 26 denials and passed everything. What matters is whether one
   * denial lands mid-loop, not how many land in a run.
   *
   * OPEN, AND NEITHER RULED IN NOR RULED OUT: `10-backup-restore` failed in the
   * EARLIER run `20260806-122122` - a different run, an hour before, and it
   * passed on a rerun. Its shape was different too: a 90s timeout waiting for a
   * generation, against a device that was alive and broadcasting INITIALIZED,
   * rather than a corrupted read. So this fix is not known to address it.
   *
   * It is also RETROACTIVELY UNTESTABLE, which is the part to respect. The
   * runner only began subscribing to 'interface-error' at 12:30:34Z, after that
   * run had finished, so that run's zero error count is an absent LOGGER, not an
   * absent fault - the leaked handle could have been active and would have left
   * no trace. Its failure block shows no splice, but a repeating identical
   * INITIALIZED broadcast is precisely the payload in which doubled delivery is
   * invisible, so that narrows nothing. Do not treat either as evidence, and do
   * not conclude from a correlation table whose early rows predate the logging.
   * Only a reproduction with the instrumentation present can settle it.
   *
   * So: close whatever is open before opening anything, and if any required
   * interface fails, close what this call opened before rethrowing. A retry
   * then starts from nothing, which is the only state it can start from safely.

     * the two are worth having together because they fail differently. Ordering
     * is what decides whether a denial can do damage at all: SEREMU is opened
     * first, so a denial on IT throws with nothing open and is harmless, while a
     * denial on VENDOR throws with SEREMU already listening. Measured across the
