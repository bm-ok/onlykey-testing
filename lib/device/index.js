/*
 * device/index.js - the one device API every test is written against.
 *
 * There is one API with two adapters behind it, and the differences between
 * them are hidden HERE rather than pushed onto test code:
 *
 *   Report ID. The proven hardware client always prepends a zero byte, but the
 *   emulator's delivery path pads to 64 and does not strip a leading report ID
 *   - so identical test code would put different bytes on the wire in each
 *   mode. Payloads carry no report ID and the hardware adapter adds it.
 *
 *   Chunking and zero-padding. The firmware already emits exactly 64 bytes for
 *   RawHID and already flushes SEREMU at 64 bytes or at a newline; the bridges
 *   re-chunk and pad only because a hidraw reader must read the descriptor's
 *   declared count. The emulated path replicates none of that, and the hardware
 *   adapter strips the padding on the way in, so both normalise to the same
 *   line stream.
 *
 * A test never constructs this. The runner builds it, prepares the device state
 * the file's metadata asks for, and injects it.
