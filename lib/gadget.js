/*
 * gadget.js - is there a kernel HID device, and whose is it?
 *
 * Section 1 needs no kernel device node; that is what lets it run in CI. Every
 * later section needs one, because python-onlykey, lib-agent and the browser
 * all find the key through hidapi. On a workstation that node can come from two
 * places - a physical key, or the emulator's USB gadget - and the difference
 * between them is invisible to any client, by design.
 *
 * The part that matters, and the reason this file is not a one-line existence
 * check: the gadget is a SINGLETON. Section 1 gives every test file its own
 * device host, its own storage and its own snapshot, because the in-process bus
 * is per-process. There is exactly one USB gadget on the machine, and whoever
 * holds /dev/hidg* open owns it - normally the developer's pm2-supervised
 * daemon, with their own device state in it.
 *
 * So a CLI run against a gadget somebody else owns is not an isolated test run.
 * It provisions PINs, writes slots and wipes things inside a device the
 * developer is using. This file exists so the kit can tell that situation apart
 * and refuse it, rather than discovering it by having trashed something.

 * WINDOWS: the same questions, answered by okvhid instead of a USB gadget.
 *
 * Windows has no gadget. The emulator reaches the OS through okvhid, a UMDF
 * driver whose four devices (SWD\DEVGEN\OKVHID_*) each serve a named pipe,
 * \\.\pipe\okvhid-0..3; the emulator connects to those as a CLIENT and Windows
 * enumerates four HID collections (HID\DEVGEN\...) that clients open like any
 * key. See node-onlykey-emulator/windows-driver. The mapping:
 *
 *   configured - all four OKVHID devices present and OK. They are created by
 *                devgen from an elevated shell and do not survive a reboot.
 *   bound      - their pipes exist.
 *   owner      - another process is already connected to the pipes (normally
 *                the pm2 daemon). A pipe takes one client, so a connect then
 *                answers busy; that is the question asked, the way /proc fds
 *                are on Linux. Asked from a child because inspect() is sync.
 *   ambiguous  - a physical OnlyKey is enumerated as well (HID\VID_1D50&PID_60FC
 *                instance ids; the emulated collections are HID\DEVGEN\...).
 *
 * The probe connects to each FREE pipe and closes at once. The driver takes
 * that as a client coming and going, which is what the bridge does on every
 * restart anyway.
