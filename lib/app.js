/*
 * app.js - section 4's long-lived service: the OnlyKey APP.
 *
 * SECTION 3 AND SECTION 4 ARE DIFFERENT CODEBASES AND BOTH GET CALLED "THE
 * APP". Section 3 is `onlykey.github.io`, a web app served by express and
 * opened in nw.js, reaching the device over the WebAuthn tunnel. This is
 * `OnlyKey-App`, a PACKAGED nw.js application - Chrome-App style, manifest
 * version 2 - that reaches the device with `chrome.hid`. lib/gui.js was built
 * for the first and had never been pointed at the second.
 *
 * Three things follow from that difference and shape everything here.
 *
 * IT IS AN APPLICATION, NOT A URL. nw.js is handed the build directory and the
 * app opens its OWN window, so there is nothing to navigate to and nothing to
 * create: this ATTACHES to a window that already exists. `GuiSession.open()`
 * calls `Target.createTarget` with a url; doing that here would open a second,
 * empty window beside the app's real one.
 *
 * IT REACHES THE DEVICE OVER `chrome.hid`, NOT WebAuthn. That removes the worst
 * failure mode section 3 has: there, a page whose startup handshake times out
 * makes Chromium raise a NATIVE WebAuthn dialog that no CDP command can dismiss
 * and the session is wedged until restarted. `chrome.hid` has no equivalent -
 * with nothing on the bus the app simply shows its disconnected dialog and
 * waits. So the "device up and unlocked before anything opens" rule does not
 * transfer for the reason it was written, and this module does not enforce it.
 * (Measured with an EMPTY bus. Device-up-but-LOCKED is not measured - see TODO.)
 *
 * IT HAS TO BE BUILT. `build/` is gitignored, so it is never in a fresh
 * checkout, and `gulp build` is a prerequisite rather than a convenience. It is
 * cheap - measured at 1.78s, and it is a file copy plus sourcemaps rather than a
 * bundler - so this builds every time instead of trying to decide whether a
 * previous build is stale. `clean` runs first, so nothing may be edited under
 * `build/` and expected to survive.
 *
 * THE INSTRUMENTATION SEAM IS NOT `chromeHid._sent`, whatever it looks like.
 * That array is appended to only when the connection is the mock's; the real
 * branch calls `chrome.hid.send` and records nothing, so against a real device
 * it stays empty forever. Two consequences: `recordWire()` below installs
 * wrappers instead, and - more usefully - the kit does not need it, because the
 * device end sees everything the app puts on the bus and is a better oracle
 * than the client's own account of what it sent.
