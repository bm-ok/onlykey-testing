/*
 * capabilities.js - what this host can actually reach.
 *
 * One host setting decides how much of the device is reachable, and it has to
 * be stated up front because it silently changes what a run even means. The
 * firmware reads its own storage through raw pointers, so the emulator maps
 * flash.bin at its real MK20DX256 addresses, and vm.mmap_min_addr decides how
 * low that mapping can start. Three rungs:
 *
 *   0x0000  everything, including fw_hash()'s walk from fwstartadr. Needs
 *           vm.mmap_min_addr=0 or CAP_SYS_RAWIO - nobody should run this.
 *   0x1000  the setting to use. certified_hw (enckeysectoradr+432 = 0x5BB0) is
 *           mapped, so crypto works, and page zero stays unmapped so a genuine
 *           NULL dereference still faults exactly as it should.
 *   0x10000 the unprivileged default. Storage at 0x3A800 is reachable and the
 *           device boots and enumerates - but okcrypto_split_sundae()
 *           dereferences certified_hw on every AES-GCM operation, so the device
 *           segfaults the moment it encrypts anything, storing a PIN included.
 *
 * That last rung is the dangerous one, because it looks like it is working
 * right up until the first test that stores a PIN. A run that lands there must
 * SAY so rather than reporting a pile of crashes, so the rung is read back and
 * treated as a capability, the same way as everything else the run cannot do.
